8. **Error Handling and Exception Handling:**
   - **Objective**: Handle errors and exceptions gracefully in web applications.
   - **Topics**:
     - Configuring error pages in web.xml.
     - Handling exceptions using try-catch blocks.
     - Custom error pages and error codes.

9. **WAR Files (Web Application Archive):**
   - **Objective**: Package and deploy web applications in a standard format.
   - **Topics**:
     - Creating a WAR file structure.
     - Deployment descriptor (web.xml).
     - Deploying a WAR file to a servlet container like Tomcat.

10. **Servlet Filters:**
    - **Objective**: Understand request and response filtering for various purposes.
    - **Topics**:
      - Filter interface and filter chains.
      - Implementing filters for authentication, logging, and data transformation.
      - Filter configuration in web.xml.

11. **Authentication and Security:**
    - **Objective**: Secure your web application with user authentication and access control.
    - **Topics**:
      - Implementing basic authentication with servlets.
      - Role-based access control (user roles and permissions).
      - Best practices for secure coding.

12. **RESTful Web Services (Optional):**
    - **Objective**: Explore RESTful services using Servlets for API development.
    - **Topics**:
      - Introduction to REST architecture.

    - **Topics**:
      - Installing and configuring Apache Tomcat.
      - Deploying web applications to Tomcat.
      - Server configuration (e.g., server.xml and context.xml).

15. **Project Work:**
    - **Objective**: Apply the learned concepts to a practical project.
    - **Outcomes**: Students should complete a web application project using Servlets and JSP, demonstrating their understanding of web development concepts.



**Outcome**: By covering these topics and objectives, students will gain a solid foundation in Java web application development using Servlets, JSP, JSTL, JDBC, WAR files, and Tomcat deployment, enabling them to build dynamic and secure web applications.
