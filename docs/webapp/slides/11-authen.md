## Authentication and Security

---

#### Introduction to Authentication and Security

- **Authentication** and **Security** are paramount in web application development, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive resources.

- Understanding key concepts in authentication and security is vital for safeguarding web applications from unauthorized access and protecting user data.

---

#### Key Concepts

1. **Authentication**:
   - The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
2. **Authorization**:
   - Determining whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform a particular action.
3. **Session Management**:
   - Maintaining the state of user interactions and data across multiple requests.

---

4. **Password Hashing**:
   - Storing user passwords in a secure, irreversible form to protect them from data breaches.
5. **HTTPS**:
   - A secure communication protocol that encrypts data between the server and the client.
6. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - An attack that injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
7. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
   - An attack that tricks users into performing unintended actions on another website.

---

#### Authentication

- **Authentication** is the process of confirming the identity of a user or system.

- Common authentication methods include:
  - Username and password.
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - OAuth and OpenID Connect for third-party authentication.

- The goal of authentication is to prevent unauthorized access to the system.

---

#### Authorization

- **Authorization** determines whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action.

- Role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) are common authorization models.

- Authorization ensures that authenticated users can only access resources and perform actions allowed by their role or privileges.

---

#### Session Management

- **Session Management** is crucial for maintaining the state of user interactions and data across multiple requests.

- Sessions are used to keep track of user identities and store session-specific data securely.

- The `HttpSession` object in Java is commonly used for session management.

---

#### Password Hashing

- **Password Hashing** involves storing user passwords in a secure, irreversible form to protect them from data breaches.

- Hash functions transform passwords into fixed-length, irreversible hash values.

- When a user logs in, their input is hashed and compared to the stored hash.

- Common hashing algorithms include bcrypt and SHA-256.

---

#### HTTPS

- **HTTPS** is a secure communication protocol that encrypts data transmitted between the server and the client.

- It prevents eavesdropping and data tampering during data transfer.

- HTTPS is essential for securing login forms and sensitive user data.

---

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is an attack that injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

- It can be prevented by sanitizing and escaping user input and using security mechanisms like Content Security Policy (CSP).

---

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is an attack that tricks users into performing unintended actions on another website.

- It can be mitigated by using anti-CSRF tokens and ensuring state-changing actions require user confirmation.

---

#### Introduction to Basic Authentication

- **Basic Authentication** is a simple yet effective method for verifying the identity of users before granting access to web resources.

- It involves sending user credentials (usually a username and password) as a base64-encoded string in the HTTP request header.

- This method is widely supported by web browsers and can be implemented in Java web applications using filters.

---

#### How Basic Authentication Works

- In Basic Authentication, the client sends an HTTP request to a protected resource.

- The client includes an **Authorization** header with the value: `Basic base64(username:password)`.

- The server decodes the base64 string to obtain the credentials, checks them against a user database, and grants access if they match.

- If the credentials are invalid, the server returns a 401 Unauthorized response.

#### Basic Authentication Filter Example

```java []
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Base64;
import javax.servlet.Filter;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebFilter;

@WebFilter("/secured/*")
public class BasicAuthFilter implements Filter {

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        // Extract Authorization header
        String authHeader = request.getHeader("Authorization");

        if (authHeader != null && authHeader.startsWith("Basic ")) {
            try {
                // Decode and parse credentials
                String base64Credentials = authHeader.substring("Basic ".length());
                String credentials = new String(Base64.getDecoder().decode(base64Credentials));
                String[] parts = credentials.split(":", 2);

                // Verify credentials (e.g., check against a user database)
                String username = parts[0];
                String password = parts[1];

                // If authentication succeeds, proceed with the request
                if (isValidUser(username, password)) {
                    chain.doFilter(request, response);
                    return;
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // Handle authentication errors
            }
        }

        // Authentication failed; send a 401 Unauthorized response
        response.setStatus(401);
        response.getWriter().write("Unauthorized");
    }

    private boolean isValidUser(String username, String password) {
        // Perform user authentication logic (e.g., check against a user database)
        // Return true if valid, false otherwise
        return false;
    }

    // Other filter methods (init, destroy) can be implemented as needed
}
```

#### Securing Resources

- In the example, the `BasicAuthFilter` is applied to resources under the `/secured/` URL pattern.

- The filter decodes and verifies credentials, checking them against a user database.

- If authentication fails, it sends a 401 Unauthorized response.

- Implement `isValidUser` to perform actual user authentication logic.
