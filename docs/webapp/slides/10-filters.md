## Servlet Filters

#### Introduction to Servlet Filters

- **Servlet Filters** are an essential component in Java web applications that allow you to perform pre-processing and post-processing of requests and responses.

- Filters provide a way to perform tasks such as logging, authentication, input validation, and more, on incoming and outgoing requests.

- Understanding key concepts of servlet filters is vital for effective request and response handling.

---

#### Key Concepts

1. **Filter Chain**:
   - A filter chain consists of multiple filters applied in a specific order.
   - Each filter can intercept and process the request or response independently.

2. **Filter Initialization**:
   - Filters are initialized when the web application starts.
   - The `init()` method is used for filter initialization tasks.

---

3. **Filter Execution**:
   - Filters are executed before and after the servlet or resource processing.
   - The `doFilter()` method contains the filter logic.

4. **Filter Mapping**:
   - Filter mappings define which servlets or URL patterns a filter should intercept.
   - Mapping is defined in the `web.xml` deployment descriptor.

---

5. **Filter Ordering**:
   - Filters can be ordered to specify the sequence in which they execute.
   - The order is determined by the filter mapping order in `web.xml`.

---

#### Filter Chain

- A **filter chain** is a sequence of filters that process a request or response in the order they are defined.

- Multiple filters can be chained together to perform different tasks on the same request.

- The sequence of execution depends on the order in which filters are defined in `web.xml`.

---

#### Filter Initialization

- **Filter Initialization** involves setting up resources, initializing variables, or configuring settings when the web application starts.

- The `init()` method is called once during filter initialization.

- Example:
  ```java []
  public void init(FilterConfig config) throws ServletException {
      // Initialization code here
  }
  ```

---

#### Filter Execution

- **Filter Execution** occurs before and after the servlet or resource processing.

- The `doFilter()` method contains the filter's core logic.

- Filters can read and modify the request or response.

- Example:
  ```java []
  public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
      throws IOException, ServletException {
      // Pre-processing code
      chain.doFilter(request, response); // Continue the filter chain
      // Post-processing code
  }
  ```

---

#### Filter Mapping

- **Filter Mapping** defines the association between a filter and specific servlets or URL patterns.

- Mapping is specified in the `web.xml` deployment descriptor.

- Example `web.xml` fragment:
  ```xml []
  <filter>
      <filter-name>MyFilter</filter-name>
      <filter-class>com.example.MyFilter</filter-class>
  </filter>
  <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>MyFilter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/secured/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
  ```

---

#### Filter Ordering

- **Filter Ordering** allows you to specify the sequence in which filters are applied.

- Filters are executed in the order defined in the `web.xml` file.

- Example filter ordering in `web.xml`:
  ```xml []
  <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>FilterA</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/pathA/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
  <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>FilterB</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/pathB/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
  ```

#### Use Cases of Servlet Filters

- **Logging and Auditing**:
  - Capture and log request and response data for auditing and debugging.

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Verify user credentials and permissions before processing requests.

- **Input Validation**:
  - Check and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.

---

- **Compression**:
  - Compress response data to optimize network usage.

- **Caching**:
  - Cache responses to improve performance and reduce server load.

---

#### Example: Logging Filter

---

#### Logging Filter

- This example demonstrates a simple Servlet Filter for logging incoming requests and outgoing responses.

- The `LoggingFilter` is responsible for pre-processing and post-processing of requests.

---

#### LoggingFilter Class

```java []
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.Filter;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;

public class LoggingFilter implements Filter {

    @Override
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
        // Initialization code goes here (optional).
    }

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        // Pre-processing logic (before the servlet is invoked)
        System.out.println("LoggingFilter: Request received from " + request.getRemoteAddr());

        // Continue the filter chain to the next filter or servlet
        chain.doFilter(request, response);

        // Post-processing logic (after the servlet has processed the request)
        System.out.println("LoggingFilter: Response sent to " + request.getRemoteAddr());
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() {
        // Cleanup code goes here (optional).
    }
}
```

- The `LoggingFilter` class implements the `Filter` interface.

---

#### Filter Execution

- **doFilter** Method:
   - Pre-processing logic logs request information before passing the request to the servlet.
   - Post-processing logic logs response information after the servlet has processed the request.

- This filter allows the request to continue processing to the servlet or the next filter in the chain.

---

#### Using the Filter

- To use this filter, configure it in the `web.xml` deployment descriptor:

```xml []
<filter>
    <filter-name>LoggingFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>com.example.LoggingFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>LoggingFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```

- This configuration maps the `LoggingFilter` to intercept all requests (`/*`) in your web application.
