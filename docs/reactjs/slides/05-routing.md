## Module 5: Routing in React

---

#### Introduction to Routing

- Routing is a fundamental aspect of building modern web applications.
- In single-page applications (SPAs), routing allows you to navigate between different views or components without causing full page reloads.
- For React applications, the de facto solution for routing is the React Router library.

---

#### React Router

- React Router is a powerful and widely-used library for declarative routing in React applications.
- It provides components like `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Link`, and `Switch` to facilitate routing.

###### Setting Up React Router
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

---

#### Basic Routing

- Start by wrapping your entire application with a `BrowserRouter` component.
- Define routes using the `Route` component, specifying a path and the corresponding component to render.

##### Example
```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

---

#### Linking Between Routes

- To navigate between different routes, use the `Link` component.
- It's essential for providing users with a means to navigate without the need for full-page reloads.

###### Example
```javascript
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/about">About</Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

---

#### Route Parameters

- Route parameters are used for dynamic routing, such as displaying user profiles or product details.
- You can access these parameters in the component using `match.params`.

###### Example
```javascript
<Route path="/user/:id" component={UserDetail} />

function UserDetail({ match }) {
  const userId = match.params.id;
  return <p>User ID: {userId}</p>;
}
```

---

#### Nested Routes

- You can nest routes within components, which is useful for complex applications.
- Employ the `Switch` component to ensure that only the first matching route is rendered.

###### Example
```javascript
<Route path="/products" component={Products} />

function Products() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Route path="/products/category/:category" component={CategoryProducts} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

#### Redirects

- Redirects are useful for guiding users from one route to another.
- Utilize the `Redirect` component to achieve this behavior.

###### Example
```javascript
<Route path="/old-route">
  <Redirect to="/new-route" />
</Route>
```

---

#### Route Guards

- Route guards are essential for securing your routes based on user permissions or conditions.
- You can use the `Route` component with a render function to implement custom logic.

###### Example
```javascript
<Route path="/admin" render={() => (isAdmin ? <AdminPanel /> : <Redirect to="/" />)} />
```

---

#### Route Animation

- To provide a more engaging user experience, you can add animations to your route transitions.
- Achieve this by utilizing CSS transitions or popular animation libraries like `react-transition-group`.

###### Example
```javascript
<Route path="/page" component={Page} />
```

```css
.page-enter {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.9);
}

.page-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: scale(1);
  transition: opacity 300ms, transform 300ms;
}

.page-exit {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: scale(1);
}

.page-exit-active {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.9);
  transition: opacity 300ms, transform 300ms;
}
```

---

#### Route Data Fetching

- In many cases, you need to fetch data when a route is activated.
- You can do this by utilizing lifecycle methods or the `useEffect` hook in functional components.

###### Example
```javascript
<Route path="/profile/:username" component={UserProfile} />
```

```javascript
function UserProfile({ match }) {
  const { username } = match.params;

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch user data based on the username
  }, [username]);

  // Rest of the component code
}
```

---

#### Summary

- Routing is an integral part of single-page applications, enabling seamless navigation within your React app.
- React Router is a highly popular and effective library for handling routing in React.
- Basic routing involves `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Link` components.
- Advanced routing includes route parameters, nested routes, redirects, route guards, animations, and data fetching.
